<h1 class="title">The Mathematical Model Behind This Simulator</h1>
</header>
<p>The <em>covidsim.in</em> simulator combines two standard mathematical models – the SEIR model for epidemic time evolution and the Gravity Model for movement of people between regions for daily work. Each Local Self Government (LSG) division (grama panchayath, municipality or municipal corporation) in Kerala is treated as a separate region. So we have 1035 regions in total – 941 grama panchayaths, 87 municipalities, 6 municipal corporations and Mahe treated as a separate region. A separate SEIR evolution is run for each region with number of people equal to the population of that region as per 2011 census. These 1035 SEIR evolutions are coupled by cross-infections through people travelling for daily work between regions. Since we do not have direct data on the number of people travelling between two regions, we assume those numbers using a simple Gravity Model that is fairly common in transportation studies. The details of each of the models and their coupling is given in the following sections. We also describe how we model the effect of various mitigation strategies like break-the-chain, complete lockdown, district boundary closures, dynamic hotspots, dynamic red/orange/green zones etc.</p>
<h1 id="timeline-of-the-virus-and-the-seir-model">Timeline of the virus and the SEIR Model</h1>
<figure>
<img src="./Timeline.png" alt="" /><figcaption>SARS-CoV-2 Timeline</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A person gets infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) virus when she comes in contact (either directly or via a shared surface) with an infectious person. A fraction of such people will start showing symptoms within 2 to 14 days (average 5.2 days) and the symptoms will typically last for around 10 days. This is called as the <em>health timeline</em> in the figure below. But what matters more for modelling is the <em>infectivity timeline</em>, which is the period during which an infected person is infectious or contagious. This period is estimated to start typically from about 1 to 2 days before the onset of symptoms and lasts typically for about 6 days. This period is marked as <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> (Infectious) in the infectivity timeline. The period before that, starting from the day of contact is marked as <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> (Exposed or Latent). This is when the virus is multiplying in her body but is still not numerous enough to be infectious. The period after <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is marked as <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> (Removed). This is when she is no longer infectious. She might still have symptoms at this stage and will typically take another 8 or more days to be cured. Note that the word “typically” is intentionally overused in this paragraph. All these timelines vary from person to person depending on their health conditions and viral load transmitted at contact.</p>
<p>The SEIR model of disease spread is based on the infectivity timeline above. It considers the total population <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> in a region as being split into four compartments based on their stage of infection. The number of people in each compartment change with time but they always add to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./SEIR.png" alt="" /><figcaption>SEIR model without mixing between regions</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The time evolution of the sizes of these four compartments is modelled by the following four ordinary differential equations.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot S   &amp;= -\beta S \frac{I}{N} \\
\dot E   &amp;= \beta S \frac{I}{N} - \frac{E}{t_E}\\
\dot I   &amp;= \frac{E}{t_E} - \frac{I}{t_I}\\
\dot R   &amp;= \frac{I}{t_I}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Here</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\beta = p C\)</span>, where</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the probability that a susceptible person who contacts an infectious person catches the disease (not all contacts transmit the disease)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is the expected number of people that a susceptible person contacts in a day.</p>
<p>Going further we will have to model it as <span class="math inline">\(C = C_h + C_w\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(C_h\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_w\)</span> are the expected number of people that a susceptible person contacts at home and work/school respectively.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(C \frac{I}{N}\)</span> therefore, is the expected number of infectious people that a susceptible person contacts in a day.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(p C \frac{I}{N}\)</span> therefore, is the probability that that a susceptible person catches the disease in a day.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(t_E\)</span> is the mean time that a person spends in compartment <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. That is, the typical time from contact of the virus till the person starts becoming infectious (contagious)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(t_I\)</span> is the mean time that a person spends in compartment <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. That is, the typical time a person remains infectious (contagious).</p></li>
<li><p>The time variable is hidden in the above equations for readability. For example, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> should be read as <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dot S\)</span> should be read as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d}{dt}S(t)\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="spatial-mixing">Spatial mixing</h1>
<p>We say that a person <em>travels</em> from region <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> to region <span class="math inline">\(R_j\)</span>, if she lives in <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> but goes daily to <span class="math inline">\(R_j\)</span> for work. We will assume that there are <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> regions in total. Let us denote by <span class="math inline">\(T_{i,j}\)</span>, the number of people travelling for work from region <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> to region <span class="math inline">\(R_j\)</span> in a day. How fast an epidemic spreads over various regions depends mainly on these numbers. Unfortunately, we do not have actual estimates for these numbers. Hence we use a commonly used mathematical model called the <em>gravity model</em> to artificially estimate these numbers.</p>
<h2 id="travel-matrix-t-from-gravity-model">Travel matrix <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> from Gravity model</h2>
<p>The gravity model needs three inputs, some of which we indirectly modelled using the population statistics. We denote the population of region <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(N_i\)</span>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span>, the number of people who travel out from region <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> every day. We need this for for every LSGD in the state. In the absence of direct estimates, we assume <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> indirectly from the 2011 census data as follows.</p>
<p>Census 2011 contains a histogram of daily travel distances of non-agricultural workers at district level resolution. Since the histogram is coarse and there is no huge variation across districts, we estimate <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(T_i = \mu N_i\)</span>, where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mu = 0.09\)</span> for regions with area less than <span class="math inline">\(25\)</span> square kilometers</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mu = 0.04\)</span> for regions with area between <span class="math inline">\(25\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> square kilometers</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mu = 0.02\)</span> for regions with area more than <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> square kilometers</li>
</ul>
<p>The values 9%, 4% and 2% used above are based, respectively, on the 2011 census estimate of the percentage of population travelling more than <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> kilometers for work (Kerala overall statistics).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(J_j\)</span> is the number of non-agricultural job opportunities in <span class="math inline">\(R_j\)</span>. We need this too for every LSGD. It will be great if one can find these numbers from a primary source. In the absence of such a source, we model it as <span class="math inline">\(J_j = \zeta N_j\)</span>, where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\zeta = 0.1\)</span> for grama panchayats,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\zeta = 0.2\)</span> for municipalities and</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\zeta = 0.3\)</span> for corporations</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Notes.</em> Only the relative magnitudes of the three zeta’s matter. We consider only non-agricultural jobs, since census data considers that agricultural sector jobs has very little contribution to long-distance (more than 5 km) daily commuting.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(d_{i,j}\)</span> is the distance between regions <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_j\)</span>. We need this for every pair of LSGDs. We use the aerial distance between the centers of the region calculated from an LSG level GIS map of Kerala.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Using these three inputs, we model the number of people <span class="math inline">\(T_{i,j}\)</span> travelling for work from region <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> to region <span class="math inline">\(R_j\)</span> in a day is as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
T_{i,j} = \alpha_i \frac {T_i J_j}{d_{i,j}^2}.
\]</span> where the normalisation factor <span class="math display">\[
\alpha_i = \left(\sum_{k \neq i}(J_k/d_{i,k}^2)\right)^{-1}.
\]</span></p>
<p>We assume the dependence on the distance to be <span class="math inline">\(T_{i,j} \propto 1/d_{i,j}^2\)</span>. This dependence is usually calibrated based on real data of job movement in a region. In the absence of such data for Kerala, we are making an arbitrary choice here based on a subjective validation of the results.</p>
<p>Putting it all together in one formula, we get</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
T_{i,j} = T_i \frac{(J_j/d_{i,j}^2)}{\sum_{k \neq i}(J_k/d_{i,k}^2)},~ \forall j \neq i,
\]</span> and then compute <span class="math inline">\(T_{i,i} = N_i - T_i\)</span>, the number of people in region <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> who work/stay in <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> itself. So if there are <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> regions in total, all these <span class="math inline">\(T_{i,j}\)</span> values are arranged as an <span class="math inline">\(r \times r\)</span> matrix <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="normal-workplace-contact-matrix-w_n">Normal Workplace Contact matrix <span class="math inline">\(W_N\)</span></h2>
<p>The <em>Normal Workplace Contact Matrix</em> <span class="math inline">\(W_N\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(r \times r\)</span> matrix in which the entry <span class="math inline">\(W_N[i,j]\)</span> is the expected number of people from region <span class="math inline">\(R_j\)</span> that a susceptible person from region <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> will contact at workplace/school during a <em>normal day</em>. We will scale this matrix appropriately for non-normal days, that is days in which any mitigation strategy is active. We model <span class="math inline">\(W_N\)</span> as a function of the population statistics and the travel matrix.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
W_N[i,j] = C_w \sum_{k=1}^{r} \frac{T_{i,k}}{N_i} \frac{T_{j,k}}{\sum_{l=1}^{r} T_{l,k}},
\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(C_w\)</span> is the expected number of people that a susceptible person contacts at work/school on a normal day,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(N_i\)</span> is the population of region <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span>, and</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(T_{i,j}\)</span> is the expected number of people travelling for work from region <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> to region <span class="math inline">\(R_j\)</span> on a normal day.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Justification.</em> If we consider a person picked uniformly at random from region <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span>, the term <span class="math inline">\(T_{i,k} / N_i\)</span> can be interpreted as the probability that she goes for work in region <span class="math inline">\(R_k\)</span> and the term <span class="math inline">\(T_{j,k} / \sum_{l=1}^{r} T_{l,k}\)</span> can be interpreted as the probability that a person she contacts at workplace (while at work in region <span class="math inline">\(R_k\)</span>) has come to work there from region <span class="math inline">\(R_j\)</span>. Notice that the total number of people in region <span class="math inline">\(R_k\)</span> during the day is not <span class="math inline">\(N_k\)</span> but <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{l=1}^{r} T_{l,k}\)</span>. Since we have chosen <span class="math inline">\(T_{k,k}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(N_k - T_k\)</span>, this sum will automatically account for the people who live and work in <span class="math inline">\(R_k\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="mitigated-workplace-contact-matrix-w_m">Mitigated Workplace Contact Matrix <span class="math inline">\(W_M\)</span></h2>
<p>The <em>mitigated workplace contact matrix</em> <span class="math inline">\(W_M\)</span> is a function of the normal workplace contact matrix <span class="math inline">\(W_N\)</span> and the various mitigation strategies like break-the-chain, lockdowns, hotspots etc that are active in the state on a day. The entry <span class="math inline">\(W_M[i,j]\)</span> will represent the expected number of people from region <span class="math inline">\(R_j\)</span> that a susceptible person from region <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> will contact at workplace/school during a day when all the active mitigation strategies are in place.</p>
<p>The effect of a containment mitigation strategy like lockdown, hotspot, red zone and orange zone in a region <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> is mathematically treated as a scaling down of the values <span class="math inline">\(W_N[i,j]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W_N[j,i]\)</span> (for all <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>) by fractions <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{LD}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{HS}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{RZ}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{OZ}\)</span> respectively. District border closure is mathematically treated as a scaling down of contacts between different districts by a fraction <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{DB}\)</span>. If multiple containment strategies are in place at the same time, then the scale-down factor selected is the one for the strongest strategy. The effect of social distancing mitigation strategies like break-the-chain is modelled as a further scale down of the above <span class="math inline">\(W_N[i,j]\)</span> values by a fraction <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{BC}\)</span>. (See the last section for default values of all these fractions). The matrix with these scaled down entries is called <span class="math inline">\(W_M\)</span>, the mitigated workplace contact matrix.</p>
<h2 id="effective-contact-matrix-c">Effective Contact Matrix <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span></h2>
<p>The <em>Effective Contact Matrix</em> <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is obtained from the mitigated workplace contact matrix <span class="math inline">\(W_M\)</span> by adding expected number of daily household contacts <span class="math inline">\(C_h\)</span> to each diagonal entry of <span class="math inline">\(W_M\)</span>. This is justified since all household contacts happen in the region of a person’s living. Moreover, we assume that no mitigation strategy is effective in reducing the household transmission of infection.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
C[i,j] &amp;= W_M[i,j], i \neq j, \\
C[i,i] &amp;= W_M[i,i] + C_h.
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<h1 id="putting-it-all-together---spatio-temporal-evolution">Putting it all together - Spatio-Temporal Evolution</h1>
<p>Finally we put all these together to form a four ordinary differential equations per region. The first two equations for each region contain terms from other regions too.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot S_i &amp;= -p S_i \sum_{j=1}^{n} C_{i,j} \frac{I_j}{N_j} \\
\dot E_i &amp;=  p S_i \sum_{j=1}^{n} C_{i,j}\frac{I_j}{N_j} - \frac{E_i}{t_E} \\
\dot I_i &amp;=  \frac{E_i}{t_E} - \frac{I_i}{t_I}\\
\dot R_i &amp;=  \frac{I_i}{t_I}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>The variables <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t_E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_I\)</span> are the same as those for the simple SEIR model described in the beginning. In the simulator we discretise the above by assuming that time advances in steps of one day, and hence treat <span class="math inline">\(\dot S_i\)</span> as the daily increment to <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span>. That is, <span class="math inline">\(\dot S_i = S_i(t+1) - S_i(t)\)</span>. Our simulator starts with the initial states of each variable, <span class="math inline">\(S_i(0)\)</span> , <span class="math inline">\(E_i(0)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(I_i(0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_i(0)\)</span> and then updates it according to the above increment rules.</p>
<h1 id="initialisation">Initialisation</h1>
<p>Currently we are doing a very simple initialisation by adding the seed numbers of infectious people entered by the user directly to Compartment <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> and keeping the <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> compartments empty. While this is a natural thing to do in a simulator, we remark that this is not a very realistic scenario once the epidemic has started spreading.</p>
