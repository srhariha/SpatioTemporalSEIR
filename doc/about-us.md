	Associate Professor, Department of Communiity Medicine,\
	Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram.

-	Dr. Sekhar Lukose Kuriakose\
	Kerala State Disaster Management Authority.

Birenjith had long discussions with Dr. Anish and Dr. Sekhar from the very
beginning. That helped us immensely in our general understanding of the
behaviour of the corona virus. Almost all the default parameters for the SEIR
model that we are using are infomed by those discussions and understanding.

  	Asst. Professor, Civil Engineering, IIT Palakkad.

- 	Dr. Sahely Bhadra\
  	Asst. Professor, Computer Science \& Engineering, IIT Palakkad.

- 	Dr. Mrinal Kanti Das\

-	Dr. Sarath Sasi\
  	Asst. Professor, Mathematics, IIT Palakkad.

-	Prof. P. B. Sunil Kumar\
	Director, IIT Palakkad.

Deepak benefitted from the discussions with the above faculty members of IIT
Palakkad. Sahely and Mrinal helped in vetting some of the parameter choices by
learning them against actual data using techniques from machine learning.
Bhavath's advice on transportation models and Sarath's inputs on the the
differential equations were helpful.  Sunil was a constant support to all the
Covid-19 related activities including this one at IIT Palakkad.
